# PLAYLISTER
### A Mp3 Playlist Manager
## A Problem
### In a world of disagreement and discussion, where man can be deemed worthy of eternal torture because of the type of TV show he likes, I believe there is only one truth we all can unanimously agree on - music slaps! Most mortals choose to listen to music on online platforms like Spotify, Apple Music or even Youtube.

### Yet the chosen few decide to directly download music as mp3 files and store them all inside one directory. This enlightenment, however, comes at a cost. While most if not all online platforms have their own sophisticated tech and methods to organize music into playlists, a native system lacks these capabilites, leaving little to no organization. Yet fear not, music downloader, for this is the app that will free you of that burden!
## The Solution
### Playlister is a Linux text-based CLI app for managing playlists of mp3 files. Assuming there exists a mp3 filled directory on your system, you can now easily create clear text lists of songs you can then pipe right into a mp3 player. 

### What is more, its AI free (who knew that one could, instead of patching design flaws with an ai product, just make a good app to begin with?) !
## Why bash?
### Since this app is a glorofied list of aliases automating simple file operations, bash felt like the tool for the job. I have also picked bash because of its popularity and speed of development. 

### I also believe bash to be a good step up from pseudo code I wrote for the project, and count on it to offload the complexity of implemeting this same program in more general purpose languages like Python (or C ... :skull:).
